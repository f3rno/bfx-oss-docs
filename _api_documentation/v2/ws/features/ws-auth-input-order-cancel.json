The order details need to include either the Internal Order ID or the Client Order ID and Client Order ID Date (YYYY-MM-DD format). Please look to the sidebar for examples.\n\nWhen you cancel an order, you will receive a message of the appropriated type on the \"account info\" channel. Example responses are included in the sidebar. Please look to the [Orders](ref:ws-auth-orders) and [Notifications](ref:ws-auth-notifications) pages for further information.\n\nOrder inputs require you to run the authentication code along with additional code for the input. The authentication code can be found  on our [Authenticated Channels](doc:ws-auth) and the additional code for inputs can be found on the [Websocket Inputs](ref:ws-input) page."
