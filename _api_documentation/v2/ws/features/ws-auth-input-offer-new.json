Please look to the sidebar for examples.\n\nUpon sending an offer, you will receive a confirmation as an 'n' (notification) event and, if the offer is placed successfully, a confirmation through a \"fon\" (funding offer new) event. Example responses are included in the sidebar. Please look to the [Funding Offers](ref:ws-auth-funding-offers) and [Notifications](ref:ws-auth-notifications) pages for further information.\n\nFunding offer inputs require you to run the authentication code along with additional code for the input. The authentication code can be found  on our [Authenticated Channels](doc:ws-auth) and the additional code for inputs can be found on the [Websocket Inputs](ref:ws-input) page."
