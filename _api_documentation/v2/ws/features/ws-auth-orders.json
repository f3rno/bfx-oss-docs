The snapshot is delivered upon subscribing and any changes to your orders will be provided as updates for as long as the channel remains open. Any authenticated connection is automatically subscribed to the account information channel.\n\nExample code to open an authenticated connection can be found on our [Authenticated Channels Page](doc:ws-auth).\n\nOrder events are sent with CHAN_ID = 0 and can be identified by looking at the TYPE stream field. Order events will use one of the following abbreviations: 'os' (order snapshot), 'on' (order new), 'ou' (order update), and 'oc' (order cancel)."
