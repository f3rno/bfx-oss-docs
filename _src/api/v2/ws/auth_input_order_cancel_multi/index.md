The Cancel Order Multi command allows sending of multiple order cancellation operations at the same time. To do this, construct a payload with the "oc_multi" (order cancel multi) abbreviation. The payload needs to include an object that specifies which orders to cancel based on Internal Order ID's, Client Order ID's (along with the cid_DATE in a YYYY-MM-DD format), Group ID, or the "all" request field. Please look to the sidebar for examples of each method.

You will receive messages to confirm your cancellation requests through "n" (notification) events and, if successful, confirmation through "oc" (order cancelled) events.  Please look to the [Orders](ref:ws-auth-orders) and [Notifications](ref:ws-auth-notifications) pages for further information on the responses you receive.

Order inputs require you to run the authentication code along with additional code for the input. The authentication code can be found  on our [Authenticated Channels](doc:ws-auth) and the additional code for inputs can be found on the [Websocket Inputs](ref:ws-input) page.
