Upon submitting the order, you will receive a message of the appropriated type on the "account info" channel. Example responses are included in the sidebar. Please look to the [Orders](ref:ws-auth-orders) and [Notifications](ref:ws-auth-notifications) pages for further information, such as the response fields.
