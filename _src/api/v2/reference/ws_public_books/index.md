** Stream Fields **

Fields | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
CHANNEL_ID | int | Identification number assigned to the channel for the duration of this connection.
PRICE | float | Price level
RATE | float | Rate level
PERIOD | float | Period level
COUNT | int | Number of orders at that price level (delete price level if count = 0)
Â±AMOUNT | float | Total amount available at that price level. Trading: if AMOUNT > 0 then bid else ask; Funding: if AMOUNT < 0 then bid else ask;

** Algorithm to create and keep a book instance updated **

1. subscribe to channel
2. receive the book snapshot and create your in-memory book structure
3. when *count* > 0 then you have to add or update the price level
3.1 if *amount* > 0 then add/update bids
3.2 if *amount* < 0 then add/update asks
4. when *count* = 0 then you have to delete the price level.
4.1 if *amount* = 1 then remove from bids
4.2 if *amount* = -1 then remove from asks
