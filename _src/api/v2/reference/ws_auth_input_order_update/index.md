To update an order, construct a payload using the "ou" (order update) abbreviation and include the desired order details. Please look to the sidebar for examples.

When you update the order, you will receive a message of the appropriated type on the "account info" channel. Example responses are included in the sidebar. Please look to the [Orders](ref:ws-auth-orders) and [Notifications](ref:ws-auth-notifications) pages for further information, such as the response fields.

Order inputs require you to run the authentication code along with additional code for the input. The authentication code can be found  on our [Authenticated Channels](doc:ws-auth) and the additional code for inputs can be found on the [Websocket Inputs](ref:ws-input) page.
